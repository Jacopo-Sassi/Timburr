                <p className="description">Timburr (Japanese: ドッコラー Dokkorer) is a Fighting-type Pokémon introduced in Generation V. It evolves into Gurdurr starting at level 25, which evolves into Conkeldurr when traded.</p>
                <h5>Biology</h5>
                <p>Timburr is a gray bipedal Pokémon with a dark purple nose and dark-gray oval-shaped eyes. Pink, vein-like bulges are present on the back of its head. Similar pink bands adorn its shoulders and thighs.</p>
                <p>It has bulbous protrusions extending from the front and lower parts of its head. It always carries squared logs and uses them to fight with. When it can easily lift a block of timber nearly three times its own weight, it is close to evolving.</p>
                <p>Timburr is usually found near construction sites, helping construction workers. It loves helping in construction so much that if rain causes work to cease, it will throw a tantrum while swinging its log. </p>
                <h5>Evolution</h5>
                <p>Timburr evolves into Gurdurr, which evolves into Conkeldurr.</p>
                <p>(For specifics on this Pokémon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data → Evolution data.)</p>
